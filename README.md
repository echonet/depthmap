# Depth Map
## 3D assessment of cardiac function

![Figure1](Figure1.png)

To simultaneously increase accuracy and utilize an approach that matches the standard clinical workflow, we propose a frame-by-frame 3D depth-map approach that is both
accurate (mean absolute error of 6.5%) and explainable, utilizing the conventional clinical workflow with method of discs evaluation of left ventricular volume. Our method directly predicts the 3D geometry of the left ventricle in the form of a depth map which can be directly evaluated to find volume and EF.
